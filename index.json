Duplication of centromeric DNA necessitates kinetochore disassembly and subsequent reassembly on the nascent sisters. To search for a regulatory mechanism that controls the earliest steps of kinetochore assembly, we studied Mif2/CENP-C, an essential basal component. We found that Polo-like kinase (Cdc5) and Dbf4-dependent kinase (DDK) phosphorylate the conserved PEST region of Mif2/CENP-C and that this phosphorylation directs inner kinetochore assembly. Mif2 phosphorylation promotes kinetochore assembly in a reconstituted biochemical system, and it strengthens Mif2 localization at centromeres in cells. Disrupting one or more phosphorylation sites in the Mif2-PEST region progressively impairs cellular fitness and sensitizes cells to microtubule poisons. The most severe Mif2-PEST mutations are lethal in cells lacking otherwise non-essential Ctf19 complex factors. These data suggest that multi-site phosphorylation of Mif2/CENP-C is a robust switch that controls inner kinetochore assembly, ensuring accurate chromosome segregation.","tags":["S. cerevisiae","cell biology","centromere","kinetochore","cell cycle","kinase"],"title":"Multi-site phosphorylation of yeast Mif2/CENP-C promotes inner kinetochore assembly","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yun Quan*","Stephen M.

The increasing prevalence of DENV worldwide heightens the need for an effective vaccine and specific antivirals. Due to the dependence of DENV upon the lipid biosynthetic machinery of the host cell, lipid signaling and metabolism present unique opportunities for inhibiting viral replication. We screened a library of bioactive lipids and modulators of lipid metabolism and identified 4-hydroxyphenyl retinamide (4-HPR) (fenretinide) as an inhibitor of DENV in cell culture. 4-HPR inhibits the steady-state accumulation of viral genomic RNA and reduces viremia when orally administered in a murine model of DENV infection. The molecular target responsible for this antiviral activity is distinct from other known inhibitors of DENV but appears to affect other members of the Flaviviridae, including the West Nile, Modoc, and hepatitis C viruses. Although long-chain ceramides have been implicated in DENV replication, we demonstrate that DENV is insensitive to the perturbation of long-chain ceramides in mammalian cell culture and that the effect of 4-HPR on dihydroceramide homeostasis is separable from its antiviral activity. Likewise, the induction of reactive oxygen species by 4-HPR is not required for the inhibition of DENV. The inhibition of DENV in vivo by 4-HPR, combined with its well-established safety and tolerability in humans, suggests that it may be repurposed as a pan-Flaviviridae antiviral agent. This work also illustrates the utility of bioactive lipid screens for identifying critical interactions of DENV and other viral pathogens with host lipid biosynthesis, metabolism, and signal transduction.","tags":["dengue virus","flavivirus","retinoic acid","therapeutics","genome replication3"],"title":"The bioactive lipid 4-Hydroxyphenyl Retinamide inhibits flavivirus replication","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Stephen M.
