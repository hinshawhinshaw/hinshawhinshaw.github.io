The kinetochore, a massive modular protein assembly, mediates this connection and also serves as a signaling hub that integrates and responds to changing cues during the cell cycle. Kinetochore functions evolve as the cell cycle progresses, culminating in the assurance of a persistent chromosome-microtubule connection during anaphase, when sister chromatids must transit into daughter cells uninterrupted. We previously determined the structure of the Ctf19 complex, a group of kinetochore proteins at the centromeric base of the kinetochore. We now present a high-resolution structure of a Ctf19 complex sub-assembly involved in centromere-microtubule contact: the Ctf3 complex bound to the Cnn1-Wip1 heterodimer. The resulting composite model of the Ctf19 complex and live-cell imaging experiments provide a mechanism for Cnn1-Wip1 recruitment to the kinetochore. The mechanism suggests feedback regulation of Ctf19 complex assembly and unanticipated similarities in kinetochore organization between yeast and vertebrates.","tags":["S. cerevisiae","cell biology","centromere","kinetochore","cryo-EM","structural biology"],"title":"The structural basis for kinetochore stabilization by Cnn1/CENP-T","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Stephen M.

Outer kinetochore proteins contact microtubules or regulate this contact directly. Inner kinetochore proteins designate the kinetochore assembly site by recognizing a specialized nucleosome containing the H3 variant Cse4/CENP-A. We previously determined the structure, resolved by cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), of the yeast Ctf19 complex (Ctf19c, homologous to the vertebrate CCAN), providing a high-resolution view of inner kinetochore architecture (Hinshaw and Harrison, 2019). We now extend these observations by reporting a near-atomic model of the Ctf3 complex, the outermost Ctf19c sub-assembly seen in our original cryo-EM density.

Unlike DNA replication, chromosome segregation has no template, and, unlike transcription, errors frequently lead to a total loss of cell viability. Rapid progress in recent years has shown how kinetochores enable faithful execution of this process by connecting chromosomal DNA to microtubules. These findings have transformed our idea of kinetochores from cytological features to immense molecular machines and now allow molecular interpretation of many long-appreciated kinetochore functions.

Establishing specific chromosomal linkages depends on cohesin recruitment to defined loci. One such locus is the budding yeast centromere, which is a paradigm for targeted cohesin loading. The kinetochore, a multiprotein complex that connects centromeres to microtubules, drives the recruitment of high levels of cohesin to link sister chromatids together. We have exploited this system to determine the mechanism of specific cohesin recruitment. We show that phosphorylation of the Ctf19 kinetochore protein by a conserved kinase, DDK, provides a binding site for the Scc2/4 cohesin loading complex, thereby directing cohesin loading to centromeres. A similar mechanism targets cohesin to chromosomes in vertebrates. These findings represent a complete molecular description of targeted cohesin loading, a phenomenon with wide-ranging importance in chromosome segregation and, in multicellular organisms, transcription regulation.","tags":["S. cerevisiae","cell biology","centromere","cohesin loading","sister chromatid cohesion","structural biology"],"title":"The kinetochore receptor for the cohesin loading complex","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Stephen M.

Initiation of sister chromatid cohesion depends on a separate complex, Scc2(NIPBL)/Scc4(Mau2) (Scc2/4), which loads cohesin onto DNA and determines its localization across the genome. Proper cohesin loading is essential for cell division, and partial defects cause chromosome missegregation and aberrant transcriptional regulation, leading to severe developmental defects in multicellular organisms. We present here a crystal structure showing the interaction between Scc2 and Scc4. Scc4 is a TPR array that envelops an extended Scc2 peptide. Using budding yeast, we demonstrate that a conserved patch on the surface of Scc4 is required to recruit Scc2/4 to centromeres and to build pericentromeric cohesion.

The increasing prevalence of DENV worldwide heightens the need for an effective vaccine and specific antivirals. Due to the dependence of DENV upon the lipid biosynthetic machinery of the host cell, lipid signaling and metabolism present unique opportunities for inhibiting viral replication. We screened a library of bioactive lipids and modulators of lipid metabolism and identified 4-hydroxyphenyl retinamide (4-HPR) (fenretinide) as an inhibitor of DENV in cell culture. 4-HPR inhibits the steady-state accumulation of viral genomic RNA and reduces viremia when orally administered in a murine model of DENV infection. The molecular target responsible for this antiviral activity is distinct from other known inhibitors of DENV but appears to affect other members of the Flaviviridae, including the West Nile, Modoc, and hepatitis C viruses. Although long-chain ceramides have been implicated in DENV replication, we demonstrate that DENV is insensitive to the perturbation of long-chain ceramides in mammalian cell culture and that the effect of 4-HPR on dihydroceramide homeostasis is separable from its antiviral activity. Likewise, the induction of reactive oxygen species by 4-HPR is not required for the inhibition of DENV. The inhibition of DENV in vivo by 4-HPR, combined with its well-established safety and tolerability in humans, suggests that it may be repurposed as a pan-Flaviviridae antiviral agent. This work also illustrates the utility of bioactive lipid screens for identifying critical interactions of DENV and other viral pathogens with host lipid biosynthesis, metabolism, and signal transduction.","tags":["dengue virus","flavivirus","retinoic acid","therapeutics","genome replication3"],"title":"The bioactive lipid 4-Hydroxyphenyl Retinamide inhibits flavivirus replication","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Stephen M.

Proteins recruited by Chl4/CENP-N include a subset that regulates chromsome transmission fidelity. We show that Chl4 and a conserved member of this subset, Iml3, both from S. cerevisiae, form a stable protein complex, which interacts with Mif2 and Sgo1. We have determined the structures of an Iml3 homodimer and an Iml3-Chl4 heterodimer, which suggest a mechanism for regulating assembly of this functional axis of the kinetochore.
